# No longer add autoloaded paths into `$LOAD_PATH`. This means that you won't be able
# to manually require files that are managed by the autoloader, which you shouldn't do anyway.
# This reduce the size of the load path, making `require` faster if you don't use bootsnap, or reduce the size
# of the bootsnap cache if you use it.

# Remove the default X-Download-Options headers since it is used only by Internet Explorer.
# If you need to support Internet Explorer, add back `"X-Download-Options" => "noopen"`.
